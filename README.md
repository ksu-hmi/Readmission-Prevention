# Readmission Prevention Tools
In progress readme file:

Goal: To create an application that can be used by parents of children who were recently discharged from the hospital
The parents will use these tools for high-risk populations at risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge.
The current population focus is children with congenital heart defects who have already had open-heart surgery.
